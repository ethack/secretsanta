# Secret Santa

No signup, no email. Just a straightforward open-source tool to help you generate your secret santa pairings. One static page, and that's it.

In the most common case (no exclusion rules, pair each guest with another at random), enter the name of your guests one line at a time. Once done, press "generate" and you're all set: send the generated links to your guests (by mail, chat, whatever floats your boat) and their pairing will be revealed to them (and only them) once they open the link.
